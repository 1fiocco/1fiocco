## Hi there 👋

My name is Riccardo Pugliese, and I am currently pursuing an MSc in Data Science. 
I graduated in March 2025 in Economics and Big Data.

Below you can find the links to my projects. Some of them are only my projects, while other are group projects.

https://github.com/1fiocco/fds-pokemon-battles-2025 
In this project we predicted the outcome of pokemons battles starting from the log of the first interactions of every match. It was a group project (me and https://github.com/LeoSuriano) for fundamentals of data science course. We did it in November 2025.


https://github.com/1fiocco/FDS_vessel_project

In this project we predicted the ship type starting from NOAA AIS data (such as lenght, wide and so on). It was a group project (me and https://github.com/LeoSuriano) for fundamentals of data science course. We did it in December 2025.


https://github.com/1fiocco/ADM-hackathon

In this project we clustered books starting from their html pages. It was a group project (me and https://github.com/LeoSuriano) for Algorithmic methods of data mining and laboratory course. We did it in December 2025.
