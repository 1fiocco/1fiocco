https://github.com/1fiocco/fds-pokemon-battles-2025<br>
In this project, we predicted the outcome of Pokémon battles starting from the log of the first interactions of each match. It was a group project (me and https://github.com/LeoSuriano) for the Fundamentals of Data Science course. We did it in November 2025.<br><br>
https://github.com/1fiocco/FDS_vessel_project<br>
In this project, we predicted the ship type starting from NOAA AIS data (such as length, width, and so on). It was a group project (me and https://github.com/LeoSuriano) for the Fundamentals of Data Science course. We did it in December 2025.<br><br>
https://github.com/1fiocco/ADM-hackathon<br>
In this project, we clustered books starting from their HTML pages. It was a group project (me and https://github.com/LeoSuriano) for the Algorithmic Methods of Data Mining and Laboratory course. We did it in December 2025.<br><br>
